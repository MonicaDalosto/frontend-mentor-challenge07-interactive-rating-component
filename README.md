## My process

- I started on the Html file, adding the semantic elements and the divs;
- In this project I didn't use the variables, because It doesn't work on some browsers.
- I tried to style the elements on CSS using classes instead of the html elements, so I chose the properly class names;
- The project is mobile first (screen: 375px);
- I had used Flexbox to position the elements on the screen;
- Then I styled the elements from the top to the bottom;
- Add the responsiveness to the desktop screens (1440px);

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile First
- Some JavaScript code

### What I learned

- I've practiced how to code using the mobile first concept
- How to use the background-position to position the images on the background
- I've tried to use more specific classes for the stylisting
- How to use forEach for method to iterate over the classes elements

### Continued development

- Practice more the flexbox tools
- Learn how to code Utility Firts CSS;
- Practice more the JS fundamentals
